# **Oops in Js**

   this.name = "Raja";
   this.color ="red";
   this.numLegs = 4 ;
}
let hound = new Dog();
```

* Constructors are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other functions that are not constructors.
* Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will create.
* Constructors define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as other functions might.
Notice that the new operator is used when calling a constructor. This tells JavaScript to create a new instance of Dog called hound. Without the new operator, this inside the constructor would not point to the newly created object, giving unexpected results. Now hound has all the properties defined inside the Bird constructor:

```
blueBird.name;
blueBird.color;
blueBird.numLegs;
```
## Extend Constructors to Receive Arguments

```
function Dog( name , color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 4;

}

let terrier = new Dog("gumb", "black" )

```
Here the value of the property passed as a parameter of the constructor dog . Then pass in the values as arguments to define each unique dog into the Dog constructor: ``` let terrier = new Dog("gumb", "black" ) ``` This gives a new instance of Dog with name and color properties set to gumb and black, respectively. The numLegs property is still set to 4. The cardinal has these properties:                           

```
terrier.name
terrier.color
terrier.numLegs
```

## Verify an Object's Constructor with instanceof

Anytime a constructor function creates a new object, that object is said to be an instance of its constructor. JavaScript gives a convenient way to verify this with the instanceof operator. instanceof allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning true or false based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor. Here's an example:

```
let Bird = function(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let crow = new Bird("Alexis", "black");

crow instanceof Bird;
```
This instanceof method would return true.

If an object is created without using a constructor, instanceof will verify that it is not an instance of that constructor:
```
let canary = {
  name: "Mildred",
  color: "Yellow",
  numLegs: 2
};

canary instanceof Bird;
```

This instanceof method would return false.

## Understand Own Properties

```
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
let ownProps = [];
// Only change code below this line 
for (let property in canary){
  if(canary.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  }
}
console.log(ownProps)
```
### Output
```
[ 'name', 'numLegs' ]
```
name and numLegs are called own properties, because they are defined directly on the instance object. That means that canary  has its own separate copy of these properties. In fact every instance of Bird will have its own copy of these properties. 

## Use Prototype Properties to Reduce Duplicate Code 
```
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

// Only change code above this line
let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

```
This may not be an issue when there are only two instances, but imagine if there are millions of instances. That would be a lot of duplicated variables.

## Iterate Over All Properties
```
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

let ownProps = [];
let prototypeProps = [];

// Only change code below this line
for (let property in beagle) {
  if(beagle.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  } else {
    prototypeProps.push(property);
  }
}

console.log(ownProps);
console.log(prototypeProps);

```
### Output:

```
[ 'name' ]
[ 'numLegs' ]
```
## Constructor property in oobs 
//code
```
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Only change code below this line
function joinDogFraternity(candidate) {
if(candidate.constructor === Dog){
    return true;
 } else {
    return false;
 }
}
```
### Output:
```
true
```
##  Set the Constructor Property when Changing the Prototype
//code

```function Dog(name) {function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

// Only change code below this line

Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

// Only change code below this line

Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);
 function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog,
  numLegs: 4,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  },
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};
```

## Understand Where an Objectâ€™s Prototype Comes From
//code

```
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);
```

### Output
```
true
```
## Use Inheritance So You Don't Repeat Yourself

There's a principle in programming called Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). The reason repeated code is a problem is because any change requires fixing code in multiple places. This usually means more work for programmers and more room for errors.

//code
```
function Cat(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Cat.prototype = {
  constructor: Cat,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

function Bear(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Bear.prototype = {
  constructor: Bear,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }            
};
//Since Animal includes the describe method, you can remove it from Bear and Cat:
Bear.prototype = {
  constructor: Bear
};

Cat.prototype = {
  constructor: Cat
};
```
## Override Inherited Methods
//code 
```
function Bird() { }

Bird.prototype.fly = function() { return "I am flying!"; };

function Penguin() { }
Penguin.prototype = Object.create(Bird.prototype);
Penguin.prototype.constructor = Penguin;

// Only change code below this line
Penguin.prototype.fly = function(){
return "Alas, this is a flightless bird.";
}

// Only change code above this line

let penguin = new Penguin();
console.log(penguin.fly());
```
### Optput

```
Alas, this is a flightless bird.
```

## Use Closure to Protect Properties Within an Object from Being Modified Externally 
The simplest way to make this public property private is by creating a variable within the constructor function. This changes the scope of that variable to be within the constructor function versus available globally. This way, the variable can only be accessed and changed by methods also within the constructor function.
//code 
```
function Bird() {
  let hatchedEgg = 10;

  this.getHatchedEggCount = function() { 
    return hatchedEgg;
  };
}
let ducky = new Bird();
console.log(ducky.getHatchedEggCount());
```
Here getHatchedEggCount is a privileged method, because it has access to the private variable hatchedEgg. This is possible because hatchedEgg is declared in the same context as getHatchedEggCount. In JavaScript, a function always has access to the context in which it was created. This is called closure.

### Output

```
10
```
## Understand the Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
A common pattern in JavaScript is to execute a function as soon as it is declared:
```
(function () {
  console.log("Chirp, chirp!");
})();
```
This is an anonymous function expression that executes right away, and outputs Chirp, chirp! immediately.

Note that the function has no name and is not stored in a variable. The two parentheses () at the end of the function expression cause it to be immediately executed or invoked. This pattern is known as an immediately invoked function expression or IIFE.
